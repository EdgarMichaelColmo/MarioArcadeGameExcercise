EXTRA CREDITS! By Edgar Michael Colmo

1. Architecture designed with FSM.
- I'm kinda unfamiliar with the architecture but, I've implemented this design on Player Movement, Player Animation, and Enemy State Modes (idle, roam around, or attack).
3. Custom visuals and shaders.
- I've implemented a free Unity Pixel Art for the game, with background and everything.
6. Leaderboards with player names supplied at the end of the game.
- Leaderboards are Hiscores are also implemented in the game. People can see the Hi-Score at game over or game finish, if they wish to do so. I've also impletements Hi-Score reset settings, and Hi-score viewable in hte main menu.
