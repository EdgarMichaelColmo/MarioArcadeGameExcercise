EXTRA CREDITS! By Edgar Michael Colmo

1. Architecture designed with FSM.
- I'm kind of unfamiliar with the architecture but, I've implemented this design on Player Movement, Player Animation, and Enemy State Modes (idle, roam around, or attack).
2.Three or more distinct consecutive levels, with increasing difficulty
- I've created 3 levels with increasing difficulty (this took the most time because of testing of how difficulty, challenging and having fun testing it), where Level 1 is kind of a tutorial area, Level 2  harder difficulty, and Level 3 needs precise landing and jumping.
3. Custom visuals and shaders.
- I've implemented a free Unity Pixel Art for the game, with background and everything.
4. Custom soundtracks and SFX
- I've implemented soundtracks and sound effects whenever the player jumps, get hit, collect coins, and finish the level. I've also added 4 Background Sound Musics of them 1 for menu and 3 for the 3 different levels.
6. Leaderboards with player names supplied at the end of the game.
- Leaderboards are Hiscores are also implemented in the game. People can see the Hi-Score at game over or game finish, if they wish to do so. I've also implements Hi-Score reset settings, and Hi-score viewable in the main menu.
